QGIS Land Degradation and Development
=====================================

This is the QGIS manual for the course Land Degradation and Development. This
documentation is based on the manual written for the course. Work performed on
creating this manual was performed out of office hours and therefore constitutes
original work of the author. Furthermore, because this tutorial is heavily based
n the documentation and a derivative work, it would not be possible to not
publicly release this tutorial. The QGIS documentation is excellent, and where
applicable, this tutorial will refer to the appropriate section in the
documentation, rather than re-doing the work done by others.

In this tutorial, there are several different levels.

* |basic| exercises are necessary to complete for the practical.
* |moderate| exercises are very useful to complete for your understanding of GIS
  and it will be *very likely* that you will need these skills later in life.
  However, you do not need to complete these for proper completion of the
  course.
* |hard| exercises are only there for the very interested students with extra
  time on their hands. Most of these are concerned with making custom processes or
  obtaining data. I personally think these are the most fun. These are there to help you
  in case you ever need to do something similar to what has been done in this practical.
  Once the manual is finished, doing these exercises will allow you to create this
  practical from scratch: from obtaining data to creating the QRichDem plugin.

The data is provided on Brightspace, and convenience scripts can be downloaded
