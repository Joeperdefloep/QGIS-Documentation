=======================
Pre-processing the data
=======================

In GIS you always need to process the raw data, to make it suitable as input for
your application. We consider this as the first step in the process. In total
there are three different phases: the pre-processing phase, where the input data
will be created from the raw data. The second phase is the processing, where
every step in the MMF method will be completed. The last phase is combining the
different steps to the complete model.
