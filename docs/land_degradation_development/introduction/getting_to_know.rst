Getting to know QGIS
====================

|basic| Getting the files
-------------------------

.. todo: See if we can get this from the Git repository - need to allow sharing

Get the files from brightspace, and unzip to a location of your choice. All
relevant files are stored in a GeoPackage and additional tabular data is stored
in an :file:`.xlsx` file. Files like these are very useful for easy data
management in Libreoffice Calc or MS Excel. Furthermore, they are also editable
in QGIS or Python.

For an introduction to the interface, follow :ref:`interface_overview`

.. Substitutions definitions - AVOID EDITING PAST THIS LINE
   This will be automatically updated by the find_set_subst.py script.
   If you need to create a new substitution manually,
   please add it also to the substitutions.txt file in the
   source folder.
