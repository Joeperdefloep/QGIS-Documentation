QGIS Land Degradation and Development
=====================================

This is the QGIS manual for the course Land Degradation and Development. This
documentation is based on the manual written for the course. Work performed on
creating this manual was performed out of office hours and therefore constitutes
original work of the author. Furthermore, because this tutorial is heavily based
n the documentation and a derivative work, it would not be possible to not
publicly release this tutorial. The QGIS documentation is excellent, and where
applicable, this tutorial will refer to the appropriate section in the
documentation, rather than re-doing the work done by others.

In this tutorial, there are several different levels.

* |basic| exercises are necessary to complete for the practical.
* |moderate| exercises are very useful to complete for your understanding of GIS
  and it will be *very likely* that you will need these skills later in life.
  However, you do not need to complete these for proper completion of the
  course.
* |hard| exercises are only there for the very interested students with extra
  time on their hands. I personally think these are the most fun :)
