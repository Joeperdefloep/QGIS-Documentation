Geo-Information Science and Sustainable Land Management (SLM)
=============================================================

Geo-information science is the field of research that links observations to a
geographical location. One of the earliest examples of GIS is a study in
19th-century London, in which cases of cholera were linked to locations. What
this study found, is that cholera outbreaks were almost always close to sewage
outlets. Since then, the field has developed enourmously, from tracking
migratory birds, to climate change modelling. Furthermore, GIS has become much
more accessible, due to the existence of open source tools and services built on
them.
