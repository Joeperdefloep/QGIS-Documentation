QGIS Land Degradation and Development
=====================================

This is the QGIS manual for the course Land Degradation and Development. This
documentation is based on the manual written for the course. Work performed on
creating this manual was performed out of office hours and therefore constitutes
original work of the author. Furthermore, because this tutorial is heavily based
n the documentation and a derivative work, it would not be possible to not
publicly release this tutorial. The QGIS documentation is excellent, and where
applicable, this tutorial will refer to the appropriate section in the
documentation, rather than re-doing the work done by others.
